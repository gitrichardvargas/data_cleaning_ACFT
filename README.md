JSON file, translatable Python skelton of a class and subclass for a mobile app to calculate US Army Combat Fitness Test scores 
I previously made an Army Combat Fitness Test Calculator mobile app using ReactNative. Since then the US Army has included varying scales for both age and gender vs the simpler gender and age neutral fitness test. I found an Excel file: https://companyleader.themilitaryleader.com/2019/11/07/acft-calculator-tracker/, that had all of the scores. I found it tedious to use, so I made cleaned the data using Pandas, created a JSON file (about 5,500 rows of data), made a class and subclass to calculate anyone's score. I have future plans to both update my prior ReactNative app and make an iOS app with more features using Swift. The Python class and subclass can be used as an easy to translate skeleton for the model in the app. The JSON file makes it easier to filter intended score charts, e.g. if a male is 30 year old then they'll be subsetted to a list of dictionaries for their age group (27-31) and gender. Additionally, the file can be further subsetted by event ('deadlift', 'two mile run', etc) to avoid redundant looping.
